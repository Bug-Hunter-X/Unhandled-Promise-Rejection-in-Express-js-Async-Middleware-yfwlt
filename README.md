# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Async Middleware

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled promise rejections in asynchronous middleware.  The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js app with an asynchronous operation that might throw an error. However, it lacks proper error handling, leading to a potential crash. The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Problem

Asynchronous operations are prevalent in modern web applications.  If these operations throw errors and the error is not caught, it can lead to unhandled promise rejections.  In Express.js, this can result in silent failures or crashes without informative error messages. 

## Solution

The solution involves using a `.catch()` block in your asynchronous middleware to handle any potential errors.  This allows for graceful error handling, such as sending a proper error response to the client or logging the error for debugging purposes.  Additional error handling mechanisms like centralized error middleware can further enhance robustness.
